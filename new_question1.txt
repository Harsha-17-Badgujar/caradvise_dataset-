It's important to refer to your vehicle's owner's manual or consult with a qualified mechanic to determine the cause of the issue and take appropriate action. 

Q: Can I switch to synthetic oil or a different grade? 

A: Yes, you can switch to synthetic oil or a different grade of oil, but it's important to do so carefully and with the proper guidance. Here are some things to consider: 

1.Consult your owner's manual: Your vehicle's owner's manual will provide specific recommendations for the type and grade of oil that is best suited for your vehicle. Make sure to follow these recommendations to ensure optimal engine performance and longevity. 

2.Understand the differences between conventional and synthetic oil: Conventional oil is made from crude oil and contains additives to help it resist breakdown and deposits. Synthetic oil, on the other hand, is made from chemical compounds and is designed to provide better performance and protection in extreme conditions. Synthetic oil is also more expensive than conventional oil. 

3.Consider the climate and driving conditions: The type of oil you use should be based on the climate and driving conditions in which you typically operate your vehicle. For example, if you live in a hot climate or frequently drive in extreme conditions, synthetic oil may be a better choice to provide better engine protection. 

4.Make sure the new oil meets the proper standards: When switching to a different type or grade of oil, make sure that it meets the proper standards set by your vehicle's manufacturer. Look for oil that has been certified by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and meets the specifications recommended in your owner's manual. 

5.Have your vehicle's oil changed by a professional: If you're unsure about the best type or grade of oil for your vehicle, or if you're not comfortable changing your vehicle's oil yourself, have it done by a qualified mechanic or oil change service. They can help you select the right oil and make sure it's installed correctly.
